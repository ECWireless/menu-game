    "For this activity, your goal will be to make smart choices when ordering food from a restaurant. By now, we hope you’ve started to get the hang of using the plate method in your day-to-day life. Now we want you to take what you know and apply that to dining out.",
    "The activity is divided into a series of food menus from different restaurants. For each menu, go through each section of the menu and choose one item that you think best adheres to the plate method. You’ll receive a check mark or an X depending on your choice, and you’ll be able to view feedback off to the side.",
    "If you make a poor choice, we’ll give you the chance to go back and choose something different. Then, once each section of the menu has an acceptable choice, you’ll see a message congratulating you on a job well done.",
    "Try your hand at each menu and remember what you’ve learned to use it in your own life. You may be surprised at what you learn! Good luck, and I’ll see you again once you’ve finished!"
